# SkillSwap

## 📌 Project Overview
SkillSwap is a peer-to-peer skill exchange platform that enables users to share knowledge and skills without monetary transactions. Users can offer skills they are proficient in (e.g., coding, photography, fitness training) and request skills they want to learn (e.g., language learning, cooking, graphic design). The platform fosters community-driven learning and collaboration.

## 🚀 Core Features
- **User Registration & Profile Management** - Users can sign up and list their offered and desired skills.
- **Skill Posting & Search** - Users can post skills and search for matches.
- **Matching & Messaging** - Users can connect with others to arrange knowledge exchanges.
- **Reputation System (Future Expansion)** - Users can leave feedback on skill exchanges.

## 🎯 Why SkillSwap?
- **Easy to Build** - Implements a simple skill-matching system with basic CRUD operations.
- **Encourages Learning** - Promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing.
- **Scalable** - Can expand with scheduling, AI recommendations, and video sessions in the future.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Planned for Future Sprints)
